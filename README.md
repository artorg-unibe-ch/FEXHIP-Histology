## Overview
- Step 0: Draw lines to define quadrants (inferior, superior, anterior, and posterior) based on uCT scans and slice geometry
- Step 1: Design model to perform automatic segmentation based on manual segmentations performed by multiple operators
- Step 2: Select regions of interest (ROIs) to perform automatic segmentation
- Step 3: Segment selected ROIs
- Step 4: Analysis segmentation results (Extract data)
- Step 5: Perform statistics
